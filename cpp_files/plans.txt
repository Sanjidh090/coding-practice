## Day 1: Review the Key Concepts and Practice Coding
Morning Session (3-4 hours): Review the Basics of OOP in C++
Classes and Objects

Understand how to define classes, create objects, and use constructors.
Review how to encapsulate data using private and public access specifiers.
Practice: Write a simple class with getter and setter methods.
Functions and Function Overloading

Learn how to declare and define functions. Understand overloading and when to use it.
Practice: Write overloaded functions to handle different argument types.
Constructors and Destructors

Understand the role of constructors and destructors in initializing and cleaning up objects.
Practice using default constructors, parameterized constructors, and copy constructors.
Practice: Write a class with different types of constructors.
Inheritance

Understand the concept of inheritance, derived and base classes, and how to extend functionality.
Practice creating base and derived classes with method overriding.
Practice: Write a program with base and derived classes.
Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation

Understand how pointers work in C++ and how to use new and delete for dynamic memory allocation.
Practice: Write a program that uses pointers to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory.
Afternoon Session (3-4 hours): Practice Problem Solving
Solve problems that involve combining the OOP concepts you've just reviewed.
Focus on class design, function implementation, dynamic memory, and pointers.
Try writing programs where you:
Create a class with attributes and methods.
Use constructors to initialize objects.
Implement inheritance and polymorphism.
Use pointers and dynamic memory allocation to create and manage arrays of objects.
Evening Session (2-3 hours): Review Code from Week 01-04
Revisit the code from Week 1 to Week 4 that you've already studied. Try to understand the underlying principles.
Test yourself by modifying the code to make sure you fully understand it.
Focus on any areas you feel less confident in, like pointer handling, dynamic memory allocation, or constructor/destructor use.
Day 2: Mock Lab Test and Advanced Topics
Morning Session (3-4 hours): Mock Lab Test
Set up a simulated lab test environment:
Give yourself 3-4 hours to write code without referring to your notes.
Choose 3-4 problems that cover key concepts from the topics.
Try to simulate a real test scenario by writing and testing your code within a time limit.
Review and correct mistakes afterward, focusing on the parts that took the most time.
Afternoon Session (2-3 hours): Advanced OOP Concepts
Review and practice advanced concepts such as:
Operator Overloading: Learn how to overload operators to make your classes more intuitive.
Polymorphism: Understand how function overriding works in derived classes and how to implement virtual functions.
File I/O: Understand file handling with ifstream and ofstream for reading from and writing to files.
Practice: Write programs that involve reading and writing files or demonstrate polymorphism.
Evening Session (2-3 hours): Final Review and Weak Areas
Spend time revisiting areas that you still find challenging.
Try to clarify any doubts with your course materials, or search for solutions online.
Make sure you understand how to implement the most commonly tested concepts like class design, inheritance, and dynamic memory.
Additional Tips:
Focus on Understanding: Don't just memorize code. Focus on how things workâ€”why and how classes, functions, inheritance, and pointers are used.
Practice with Examples: Instead of passively reading, write out the code yourself. This will help reinforce your understanding.
Take Breaks: Don't study for hours on end without breaks. Take short breaks to refresh your mind and maintain focus.
By the end of Day 2, you should be comfortable with OOP in C++ and ready to tackle your lab test. If you have any specific doubts or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
